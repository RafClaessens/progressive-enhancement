<h2>The story
</h2>

<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <div class="villagers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</div> The farmer said, <strong class="farmer">"Maybe"</strong>. The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, <strong class="farmer">“Maybe.”</strong> 
<br>
    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,<div class="villagers">“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</div>  and the farmer responded, <strong class="farmer">“Maybe.” </strong>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <div class="villagers">“Isn’t that great!”</div> Again, he said, <strong class="farmer">“Maybe.”</strong>
    <br>
    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

<p>  Conclusion<br>
    <span class="goody">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
